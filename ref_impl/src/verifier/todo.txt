- Implement in Fstar the Bosque collection library
- Axiomatize (currently establish relations between compositions between the function of the collection library), prove, and include an appropriate trigger for these lemmas.
- Write these results in the paper


Bosque Collection library:
- List:
  - size : list T -> integer
  - exists list T -> (T -> bool) -> bool
  - all : list T -> (T -> bool) -> bool
  - filter : list T -> int ->
- Set:
- Map:

I think is better to take a look to their actual implementation. And then reimplement these functions in Fstar.
