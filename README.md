[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bosquepl/BosqueDevOps/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.BosqueLanguage?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/bosquepl/BosqueDevOps/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

The Bosque programming language is a [_Microsoft Research_](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/bosque-programming-language/) project on building the development platform for the future of Cloud and IoT application development. The key design features of the language provide ways to avoid _accidental complexity_ in the language, provide semantics that can be easily reasoned about (with automated tools), and in a package that is approachable for developers. The result is improved developer productivity, increased software quality, and a range of new compilers and developer tooling experiences.

Small samples of code to give a sample flavor are below ([Code Snippets](#Code-Snippets)). A rundown of notable and/or unique features in the Bosque language is provided in the [language overview section 0](docs/language/overview.md#0-Highlight-Features).
For a look at how the language works and flows _in the large_ please see the code for a [simple tic-tac-toe](ref_impl/src/test/apps/tictactoe/main.bsq) program that supports updating the board with user supplied moves, making an automated computer move, and managing the various game state.

**Note:** This repository and code represent an alpha state. This means that the language is subject to revision, there are bugs and missing functionality, and the performance is limited. Thus, we **do not** recommend the use of the Bosque language for _any_ production work and instead encourage experimentation only with small/experimental side projects at this point in time.

## News
**Dec 2019**

We have forked off the original v1 version of the language and the master branch is now for the active development of an alpha version!

1. The language semantics have undergone substantial revisions.
2. An Ahead-of-Time compiler is now supported to produce native code (WASM support is planned).
3. A symbolic-tester is provided to augment the use of unit-testing.

## Code Snippets

Add 2 numbers:

```none
function add2(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return x + y;
}

add2(2, 3) //5
```

All odd check using rest parameters and lambda:

```none
function allOdd(...args: List<Int>): Bool {
    return args->all(fn(x) => x % 2 == 1);
}

allOdd(1, 3, 4) //false
```

Bulk update properties on Record

```none
function updatePoint(point: {x: Int, y: Int, z: Int}, value: Int): {x: Int, y: Int, z: Int} {
    return point->updatePoint(y=value, x=-point.x);
}

updatePoint({x=1, y=2, z=3}, 5) //{x=-1, y=5, z=3}
```

Noneable access on optional argument:

```none
function tryGetProperty(r?: {f: Int, k: Int}): Int? {
    return r?.f;
}

tryGetProperty({f=2, k=1}) //2
tryGetProperty()           //none
```

Sign (with optional argument):

```none
function sign(x?: Int): Int {
    var! y: Int;

    if(x == none || x == 0) {
        y = 0;
    }
    else {
        y = (x > 0) ? 1 : -1;
    }

    return y;
}

sign(5)    //1
sign(-5)   //-1
sign()     //0
```

## Using the Bosque Language

The current focus of the Bosque project is core language design. As a result there is _no_ support for packaging, deployment, lifecycle management, etc.

### Requirements

In order to build the language the following are needed:

- 64 bit Operating System
- The LTS version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ( According to your OS )
- Typescript (install with: `npm i typescript -g`)
- A C++ compiler -- by default `clang` on Windows and `g++` on Linux/Mac

### Build & Test

The `ref_impl` directory contains the reference implementation parser, type checker, interpreter, and command line runner. In this directory, build and test the Bosque reference implementation with:

```none
npm install && npm test
```

Note: the Z3 theorem prover is provided as a binary dependency in the repo via git LFS. To ensure these are present you will need to have [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed, run `git lfs install` to setup the needed hooks, and pull. 

### Executable Generation

Bosque supports the generation of standalone command-line executables via the `ExeGen` tool. Details on this tool can be found in the [readme](./ref_impl/src/runtimes/exegen/README.md).

A simple example use is to create a file called "max.bsq" with the following code:
```
namespace NSMain;

entrypoint function main(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    return (x > y) ? x : y;
}
```
Then run the following command to produce the `max.exe` (on Windows executable) which can then be invoked with:
```
> node ref_impl\bin\runtimes\exegen\exegen.js -o max.exe max.bsq
```
Which will create an executable named `max.exe` in the current directory.

Running this executable:
```
> max.exe 1 5
```
Will output `5`.

### Symbolic Testing

SymTest is a powerful command line tool for symbolically testing Bosque source code. Details on this symbolic checker can be found in the [readme](./ref_impl/src/runtimes/symtest/README.md).

A sample application for a `division` command line calculator would be to create a file called `division.bsq` with the contents:
```
namespace NSMain;

entrypoint function main(x: Int, y: Int): Int 
    //requires y != 0;
{
    return x / y;
}
```

Then run the following command to check for errors:
```
> node bin\runtimes\symtest\symtest.js division.bsq
```
Which will report that an error is possible.

Re-running the symbolic tested with model generation on as follows:
```
> node bin\runtimes\symtest\symtest.js -m division.bsq
```
Will report that an error is possible when `x == 0` and `y == 0`.

By un-commenting the requires line the tester will assume that the required condition is always satisfied and re-running the tester will now report that the code has been verified up to the bound.

### Visual Studio Code Integration

This repository provides basic [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE support for the Bosque language (currently limited to syntax and brace highlighting). The installation requires manually copying the full `bosque-language-tools/` folder into your user `.vscode/extensions/` directory and restarting VSCode.
