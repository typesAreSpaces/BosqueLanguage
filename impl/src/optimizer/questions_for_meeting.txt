# What should we include from MIRInvokeDecl in the comparison?
i.e. is { 
  enclosingDecl, preconditions, postconditions} relevant?

## Discuss the example and hilarious results obtained.

# Immediate solution to the current result: add types to
distinguish blocks (and... 
key,
attributes,
recursive, 
pragmas,
params,
resultType
)
